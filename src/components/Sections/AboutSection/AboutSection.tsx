          For the past 4 years, I have been passionate about web application development with a
          focus on the frontend. With over 2.5 years of professional experience, I have dedicated
          myself to furthering my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
          <br />I graduated from the West Pomeranian University of Technology with a bachelor&#39;s
          degree in computer science. Currently, I am studying management at the University of
          Szczecin on the weekends in pursuit of a master&#39;s degree.
