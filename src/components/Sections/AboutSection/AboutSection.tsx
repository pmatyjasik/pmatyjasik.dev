            have dedicated myself to furthering my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
            <br />
            <br />I graduated from the West Pomeranian University of Technology with a
            bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science. Currently, I am studying management at the
            University of Szczecin on the weekends in pursuit of a master&#39;s degree.
